This is a very simple piece of code, and it's behaviour is pretty straight forward.
Just create a FILE were you will copy the results from Oracle's "apex", run the program and the resulting table will be **COPIED TO YOUR CLIPBOARD** and will also be printed on screen.  
The syntax to make it work is even simpler: 

`./sql-table2md-table.py -f [PATH to your INPUT file]`

And it's done!
